// UPDATED PROJECT PROPOSAL (June 5th, 2018)

*Raspbaraoke (A Karaoke Machine)

*Maika Isogwa, Gen Singer, Callan Hoskins

*Raspbaraoke: a device that allows the user to choose a song to sing along to. Once the song is selected,
the Raspberry Pi sends the instructions to play the selected song, and displays the words on the monitor.
As the song plays, the monitor will update with the associated lyrics. A microphone will be available for the user.

*Reasoning for the pivot in project concept: we wanted to have a more full, robust project that integrated more components of what we learned in class over the past ten weeks. We can still utilize all of our work and software so far, and this extra-interactive project will add a level of interest for the final presentation as well.

*Hardware required: speakers, monitor, basic materials in our kit, a music chip
*Funds requested: 0
*Major task breakdown:
1. Song selection to play from pi (Gen)
2. Hardware setup - controlling the physical setup of the project, speaker setup, breadbording, display, etc. (Maika)
3. Mp3 control software - (Gen (lead), Callan, Maika)
4. Sending input via bluetooth or external microphone components (Callan)
5. Secondary UART and bit-bang between pi and music player (Maika, Callan)
6. Displaying lyrics on screen
7. Song structs with encoded time delays specialized to each song

*Goals for this week: play a song via instructions sent from the pi to the music chip
*References and sources: none yet, other than the incredible minds of the teaching team


// PREVIOUS PROPOSAL
<!--* Looping Machine-->
<!--* Maika Isogawa, Gen Singer, Callan Hoskins-->
<!--* Looping machine: a device that plays a recorded loop (of approx. 10 secs)-->
<!--  that can be used as a background track for music. Ideally, one should-->
<!--  be able to add a sound to the loop and have it become part of the loop-->
<!--  being replayed over and over (i.e. if you add a bell sound to the playing-->
<!--  track, that bell sound will be heard on the loop for as long as it plays).-->
<!---->
<!--* Hardware required: speakers (can be borrowed), basic hardware components-->
<!--  already in our kit, (possibly) bluetooth module to control remotely.-->
<!--* Funds requested: 0-->
<!--* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task: -->
<!--  1. Playing songs from the Pi (Gen)-->
<!--  2. Hardware setup - being able to control the physical processes that-->
<!--     make music (Maika)-->
<!--  3. Sending input via bluetooth or other serial communication (Callan)-->
<!--  4. Secondary UART and bit-bang between pi and music player (Maika)-->
<!--* Goals for this week: Play music from the Pi, be able to receive scan--->
<!--  codes from the Bluetooth module-->
<!--* References and resources used: None yet-->
