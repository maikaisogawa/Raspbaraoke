Here is a suggested outline for your proposal. You don't need to follow this
outline, but it may help you focus your project.

* Looping Machine
* Maika Isogawa, Gen Singer, Callan Hoskins
* Looping machine: a device that plays a recorded loop (of approx. 10 secs)
  that can be used as a background track for music. Ideally, one should
  be able to add a sound to the loop and have it become part of the loop
  being replayed over and over (i.e. if you add a bell sound to the playing
  track, that bell sound will be heard on the loop for as long as it plays).

* Hardware required: speakers (can be borrowed), basic hardware components
  already in our kit, (possibly) bluetooth module to control remotely.
* Funds requested: 0
* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task: 
  1. Playing songs from the Pi (Gen)
  2. Hardware setup - being able to control the physical processes that
     make music (Maika)
  3. Sending input via bluetooth or other seial communication (Callan)
* Goals for this week: Play music from the Pi, be able to receive scan-
  codes from the Bluetooth module
* References and resources used: None yet
